This is a solution for people in groups that need to decide to get food based off multiple people's opinion. It gathers everyones opinion so that the poll creator can determine what type of food to get. This was designed to work on both your personal computer as well as your mobile device.

## Flow

  2. User shares poll link with other users.
  3. Everyone enters link and selects their preference.
  4. User view results.
  5. View suggested restaurants using Google Places Search API. Currently limited to 10 responses per option.
## TODO:
